This package facilitates storing artifacts in Content Addressable Storage via the `hashfs` library. Artifacts may include large files like datasets or serialized models, as well as wrapper classes containing any necessary metadata.

Files are stored in the local filesystem at a path of the user's choosing and managed by the `hashfs` library.
